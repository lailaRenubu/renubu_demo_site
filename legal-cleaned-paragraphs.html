        <p>information when we believe it is necessary and we have a valid legal reason</p>
        <p>(i.e., legal basis) to do so under applicable law, like with your consent, to</p>
        <p>comply with laws, to provide you with services to enter into or fulfill our</p>
        <p>contractual obligations, to protect your rights, or to fulfill our legitimate</p>

        <p>abuse</p>
        <p>If it is reasonable to expect collection and use with consent would</p>
        <p>compromise the availability or the accuracy of the information and the</p>
        <p>collection is reasonable for purposes related to investigating a breach of an</p>
        <p>agreement or a contravention of the laws of Canada or a province</p>
        <p>If</p>
        <p>disclosure is required to comply with a subpoena, warrant, court order, or rules</p>
        <p>of the court relating to the production of records</p>
        <p>If it was produced by</p>
        <p>an individual in the course of their employment, business, or profession and the</p>
        <p>collection is consistent with the purposes for which the information was</p>
        <p>produced</p>
        <p>If the collection is solely for journalistic, artistic, or</p>
        <p>literary purposes</p>
        <p>If the information is publicly available and is</p>
        <p>specified by the regulations</p>

        <p>line with our Privacy Notice and our agreement with third parties. This ensures</p>
        <p>high security and safeguards your personal information throughout the process,</p>
        <p>giving you peace of mind about your data's safety.</p>
        <p>7.</p>
        <p>HOW DO WE HANDLE YOUR SOCIAL LOGINS?</p>
        <p>In Short: If you choose to register</p>
        <p>or log in to our Services using a social media account, we may have access to</p>
        <p>certain information about you.</p>
        <p>Our Services offer you the</p>
        <p>ability to register and log in using your third-party social media account</p>
        <p>details (like your Facebook or X logins). Where you choose to do this, we will</p>
        <p>receive certain profile information about you from your social media provider.</p>
        <p>The profile information we receive may vary depending on the social media</p>
        <p>provider concerned, but will often include your name, email address, friends</p>
        <p>list, and profile picture, as well as other information you choose to make</p>
        <p>public on such a social media platform.</p>
        <p>We will use the</p>
        <p>information we receive only for the purposes that are described in this Privacy</p>
        <p>Notice or that are otherwise made clear to you on the relevant Services. Please</p>
        <p>note that we do not control, and are not responsible for, other uses of your</p>
        <p>personal information by your third-party social media provider. We recommend</p>
        <p>that you review their privacy notice to understand how they collect, use, and</p>
        <p>share your personal information, and how you can set your privacy preferences on</p>
        <p>their sites and apps.</p>
        <p>8. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR</p>
        <p>INFORMATION?</p>
        <p>In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary</p>
        <p>to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise</p>
        <p>required by law.</p>
        <p>We will only keep your personal</p>
        <p>information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this</p>
        <p>Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law</p>
        <p>(such as tax, accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this</p>
        <p>notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer than the</p>
        <p>period of time in which users have an account with us.</p>
        <p>When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your</p>
        <p>personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such information, or,</p>
        <p>if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information has been</p>
        <p>stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal</p>
        <p>information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is</p>
        <p>possible.</p>
        <p>9. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</p>
        <p>In Short: We aim to protect your personal information through a system of</p>
        <p>organizational and technical security measures.</p>
        <p>We have</p>
        <p>implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security</p>
        <p>measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we</p>
        <p>process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information,</p>
        <p>no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology</p>
        <p>can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that</p>
        <p>hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to</p>
        <p>defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your</p>
        <p>information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information,</p>
        <p>transmission of personal information to and from our Services is at your own</p>
        <p>risk. You should only access the Services within a secure</p>
        <p>environment.</p>
        <p>10. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM</p>
        <p>MINORS?</p>
        <p>In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to</p>
        <p>children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your</p>
        <p>jurisdiction.</p>
        <p>We do not knowingly collect, solicit data</p>
        <p>from, or market to children under 18 years of age or the equivalent age as</p>
        <p>specified by law in your jurisdiction, nor do we knowingly sell such personal</p>
        <p>information. By using the Services, you represent that you are at least 18 or</p>
        <p>the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction or that you are the</p>
        <p>parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to such minor dependent's use</p>
        <p>of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18</p>
        <p>years of age or the equivalent age as specified by law in your jurisdiction has</p>
        <p>been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to</p>
        <p>promptly delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we</p>
        <p>may have collected from children under age 18 or the equivalent age as specified</p>
        <p>by law in your jurisdiction, please contact us at</p>
        <p>[email protected]</p>

        <p>11. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</p>
        <p>In Short: Depending on your</p>
        <p>state of residence in the US or in some regions, such as Canada, you have rights</p>
        <p>that allow you greater access to and control over your personal information. You</p>
        <p>may review, change, or terminate your account at any time, depending on your</p>
        <p>country, province, or state of residence.</p>
        <p>In some regions</p>
        <p>(like Canada), you have certain rights under applicable data protection laws.</p>
        <p>These may include the right (i) to request access and obtain a copy of your</p>
        <p>personal information, (ii) to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to</p>
        <p>restrict the processing of your personal information; (iv) if applicable, to</p>
        <p>data portability; and (v) not to be subject to automated decision-making. If a</p>
        <p>decision that produces legal or similarly significant effects is made solely by</p>
        <p>automated means, we will inform you, explain the main factors, and offer a</p>
        <p>simple way to request human review. In certain circumstances, you may also have</p>
        <p>the right to object to the processing of your personal information. You can make</p>
        <p>such a request by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the</p>
        <p>section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
        <p>We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with</p>
        <p>applicable data protection laws.</p>
        <p>Withdrawing your consent:</p>
        <p>If we are relying on your consent to process your personal information, which</p>
        <p>may be express and/or implied consent depending on the applicable law, you have</p>
        <p>the right to withdraw your consent at any time. You can withdraw your consent at</p>
        <p>any time by contacting us by using the contact details provided in the section</p>
        <p>"HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below.</p>
        <p>However, please note that this will not affect the lawfulness of the</p>
        <p>processing before its withdrawal nor, when applicable law allows, will it affect</p>
        <p>the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on lawful</p>
        <p>processing grounds other than consent.</p>
        <p>Opting out of</p>
        <p>marketing and promotional communications: You can unsubscribe from our marketing</p>
        <p>and promotional communications at any time by clicking on the unsubscribe link</p>
        <p>in the emails that we send, or by contacting us using the details provided in</p>
        <p>the section "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US ABOUT THIS NOTICE?" below. You</p>
        <p>will then be removed from the marketing lists. However, we may still communicate</p>
        <p>with you — for example, to send you service-related messages that are necessary</p>
        <p>for the administration and use of your account, to respond to service requests,</p>
        <p>or for other non-marketing purposes.</p>
        <p>Account</p>
        <p>Information</p>
        <p>If you would at any time like to review or change the</p>
        <p>information in your account or terminate your account, you can:</p>
        <p>Log in to your account settings and update your user account.</p>
        <p>Upon your request to terminate your account, we will deactivate or delete your</p>
        <p>account and information from our active databases. However, we may retain some</p>
        <p>information in our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with</p>
        <p>any investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable legal</p>
        <p>requirements.</p>
        <p>Cookies and similar technologies: Most Web</p>
        <p>browsers are set to accept cookies by default. If you prefer, you can usually</p>
        <p>choose to set your browser to remove cookies and to reject cookies. If you</p>
        <p>choose to remove cookies or reject cookies, this could affect certain features</p>
        <p>or services of our Services.</p>
        <p>If you have questions or</p>
        <p>comments about your privacy rights, you may email us at</p>
        <p>[email protected]</p>
        <p>.</p>
        <p>12. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</p>
        <p>Most web browsers and</p>
        <p>some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track</p>
        <p>("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy</p>
        <p>preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and</p>
        <p>collected. At this stage, no uniform technology standard for recognizing and</p>
        <p>implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently</p>
        <p>respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically</p>
        <p>communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online</p>
        <p>tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about</p>
        <p>that practice in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.</p>
        <p>California law requires us to let you know how we respond to web</p>
        <p>browser DNT signals. Because there currently is not an industry or legal</p>
        <p>standard for recognizing or honoring DNT signals, we do not respond to them at</p>
        <p>this time.</p>
        <p>13. DO UNITED STATES RESIDENTS HAVE SPECIFIC</p>

        <p>document.</p>
        <p>Under certain US state data protection laws, you</p>
        <p>can designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. We may deny</p>
        <p>a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have</p>
        <p>been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with applicable</p>
        <p>laws.</p>
        <p>Request Verification</p>
        <p>Upon receiving your</p>
        <p>request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same</p>
        <p>person about whom we have the information in our system. We will only use</p>
        <p>personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or</p>
        <p>authority to make the request. However, if we cannot verify your identity from</p>
        <p>the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide</p>
        <p>additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity and for</p>
        <p>security or fraud-prevention purposes.</p>
        <p>If you submit the</p>
        <p>request through an authorized agent, we may need to collect additional</p>

        <p># COOKIE</p>
        <p>POLICY</p>
        <p>Last updated September 08,</p>
        <p>2025</p>
        <p>This Cookie Policy explains how Renubu,</p>
        <p>Inc. ("Company," "we," "us," and "our")</p>
        <p>uses cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our</p>
        <p>website at https://renubu.com ("Website"). It explains what these</p>
        <p>technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use</p>
        <p>of them.</p>
        <p>In some cases we may use cookies to collect</p>
        <p>personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it with</p>
        <p>other information.</p>
        <p>## What are cookies?</p>
        <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or</p>
        <p>mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website</p>
        <p>owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as</p>
        <p>well as to provide reporting information.</p>
        <p>Cookies set by</p>
        <p>the website owner (in this case, Renubu, Inc.) are called "first-party</p>
        <p>cookies." Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called</p>
        <p>"third-party cookies." Third-party cookies enable third-party features</p>
        <p>or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising,</p>
        <p>interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party</p>
        <p>cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question</p>
        <p>and also when it visits certain other websites.</p>
        <p>## Why do</p>
        <p>we use cookies?</p>
        <p>We use first- and third-party cookies for</p>
        <p>several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for</p>
        <p>our Website to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or</p>
        <p>"strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track</p>
        <p>and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Online</p>
        <p>Properties. Third parties serve cookies through our Website for advertising,</p>
        <p>analytics, and other purposes. This is described in more detail</p>
        <p>below.</p>
        <p>## How can I control cookies?</p>
        <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You</p>
        <p>can exercise your cookie rights by setting your preferences in the Cookie</p>
        <p>Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which</p>
        <p>categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected</p>
        <p>as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.</p>
        <p>The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the notification banner and</p>
        <p>on our Website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our Website</p>
        <p>though your access to some functionality and areas of our Website may be</p>
        <p>restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or</p>
        <p>refuse cookies.</p>
        <p>The specific types of first- and</p>
        <p>third-party cookies served through our Website and the purposes they perform are</p>
        <p>described in the table below (please note that the specific cookies served may</p>
        <p>vary depending on the specific Online Properties you visit):</p>
        <p>## How can I control cookies on my browser?</p>
        <p>As</p>
        <p>the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary</p>
        <p>from browser to browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more</p>
        <p>information. The following is information about how to manage cookies on the</p>
        <p>most popular browsers:</p>
        <p>-</p>
        <p>Chrome</p>
        <p>-</p>
        <p>Internet</p>
        <p>Explorer</p>
        <p>-</p>
        <p>Firefox</p>
        <p>-</p>
        <p>Safari</p>
        <p>-</p>
        <p>Edge</p>
        <p>-</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of</p>
        <p>targeted advertising. If you would like to find out more information, please</p>
        <p>visit:</p>

        <p>## What about other tracking</p>
        <p>technologies, like web beacons?</p>
        <p>Cookies are not the only</p>
        <p>way to recognize or track visitors to a website. We may use other, similar</p>
        <p>technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called</p>
        <p>"tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"). These are tiny graphics</p>
        <p>files that contain a unique identifier that enables us to recognize when someone</p>
        <p>has visited our Website or opened an email including them. This allows us, for</p>
        <p>example, to monitor the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website</p>
        <p>to another, to deliver or communicate with cookies, to understand whether you</p>
        <p>have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a third-party</p>
        <p>website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of email</p>
        <p>marketing campaigns. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on</p>
        <p>cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their</p>
        <p>functioning.</p>
        <p>## Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared</p>
        <p>Objects?</p>
        <p>Websites may also use so-called "Flash</p>
        <p>Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among</p>
        <p>other things, collect and store information about your use of our services,</p>
        <p>fraud prevention, and for other site operations.</p>
        <p>If you do</p>
        <p>not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of</p>
        <p>your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in</p>
        <p>the</p>
        <p>Website</p>
        <p>Storage Settings Panel</p>
        <p>. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to</p>
        <p>the</p>
        <p>Global</p>
        <p>Storage Settings Panel</p>
        <p>and following the instructions (which may include</p>
        <p>instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies</p>
        <p>(referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent</p>
        <p>Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for</p>
        <p>Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being</p>
        <p>delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).</p>
        <p>Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit</p>
        <p>acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash</p>
        <p>applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with</p>
        <p>our services or online content.</p>
        <p>## Do you serve targeted</p>
        <p>advertising?</p>
        <p>Third parties may serve cookies on your</p>
        <p>computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Website. These</p>
        <p>companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in</p>
        <p>order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may</p>
        <p>be interested in. They may also employ technology that is used to measure the</p>
        <p>effectiveness of advertisements. They can accomplish this by using cookies or</p>
        <p>web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in</p>
        <p>order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential</p>
        <p>interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable</p>
        <p>us or them to identify your name, contact details, or other details that</p>
        <p>directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.</p>
        <p>## How often will you update this Cookie Policy?</p>
        <p>We may update this Cookie Policy from time to time in order to</p>
        <p>reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational,</p>
        <p>legal, or regulatory reasons. Please therefore revisit this Cookie Policy</p>
        <p>regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related</p>
        <p>technologies.</p>
        <p>The date at the top of this Cookie Policy</p>
        <p>indicates when it was last updated.</p>

        <p>The information provided when using the</p>

        <p>## 11. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
        <p>###</p>
        <p>Informal Negotiations</p>
        <p>To expedite resolution and control</p>
        <p>the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Legal Terms</p>
        <p>(each a "Dispute" and collectively, the "Disputes") brought</p>
        <p>by either you or us (individually, a "Party" and collectively, the</p>
        <p>"Parties"), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any</p>
        <p>Dispute (except those Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least</p>
        <p>30 days before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon</p>
        <p>written notice from one Party to the other Party.</p>
        <p>###</p>
        <p>Binding Arbitration</p>
        <p>Any dispute arising out of or in</p>
        <p>connection with these Legal Terms, including any question regarding its</p>
        <p>existence, validity, or termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved</p>
        <p>by the International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European Arbitration</p>
        <p>Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according to the Rules of this</p>
        <p>ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is considered as the part of this</p>
        <p>clause.</p>
        <p>### Restrictions</p>
        <p>The Parties agree that any</p>
        <p>arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To</p>
        <p>the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any</p>
        <p>other proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be</p>
        <p>arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action procedures; and</p>
        <p>(c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported</p>
        <p>representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other</p>
        <p>persons.</p>
        <p>### Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and</p>
        <p>Arbitration</p>

        <p>are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations binding</p>
        <p>arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the</p>
        <p>validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute</p>
        <p>related to, or arising from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy,</p>
        <p>or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for injunctive relief. If this provision</p>
        <p>is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect to</p>
        <p>arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be</p>
        <p>illegal or unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of</p>
        <p>competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the</p>
        <p>Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.</p>

        <p>These Legal Terms and any</p>
        <p>policies or operating rules posted by us on the Services or in respect to the</p>
        <p>Services constitute the entire agreement and understanding between you and us.</p>
        <p>Our failure to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Legal Terms</p>
        <p>shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. These Legal Terms</p>
        <p>operate to the fullest extent permissible by law. We may assign any or all of</p>
        <p>our rights and obligations to others at any time. We shall not be responsible or</p>
        <p>liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure to act caused by any cause beyond</p>
        <p>our reasonable control. If any provision or part of a provision of these Legal</p>
        <p>Terms is determined to be unlawful, void, or unenforceable, that provision or</p>
        <p>part of the provision is deemed severable from these Legal Terms and does not</p>
        <p>affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions. There is no</p>
        <p>joint venture, partnership, employment or agency relationship created between</p>
        <p>you and us as a result of these Legal Terms or use of the Services. You agree</p>
        <p>that these Legal Terms will not be construed against us by virtue of having</p>
        <p>drafted them. You hereby waive any and all defenses you may have based on the</p>
        <p>electronic form of these Legal Terms and the lack of signing by the parties</p>
